# Change log

All notable changes to the LaunchDarkly Ruby SDK will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [8.8.1](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/compare/8.8.0...8.8.1) (2024-10-30)


### Bug Fixes

* Modify data kind constants to avoid Process.warmup rehash ([#301](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/301)) ([06f11f0](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/commit/06f11f0757555cc680776f747dfa68ca7e278cb6))

## [8.8.0](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/compare/8.7.1...8.8.0) (2024-10-16)


### Features

* Add support for client-side prerequisite events ([#299](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/299)) ([021451c](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/commit/021451cd3fc83fb3701e8a1d02f187e8baa18bb1))

## [8.7.1](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/compare/8.7.0...8.7.1) (2024-09-06)


### Bug Fixes

* Add additional payload filter key validation ([#295](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/295)) ([75d6c6a](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/commit/75d6c6af595350f3a10e6215edb06647d5f0ea13))

## [8.7.0](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/compare/8.6.0...8.7.0) (2024-07-25)

This release introduces the ability to enable compression of event payloads. When enabled, the SDK will compress events before sending them to the LaunchDarkly servers. This can reduce the bandwidth required to send events, which can be useful in high-traffic environments to reduce egress traffic costs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Relay Proxy users **MUST** upgrade to version 8.9 or higher prior to enabling this option to prevent loss of event data.
>
> However, enabling this feature is **NOT** required when using the Relay Proxy as it will manage compression automatically.

## [8.4.1](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/compare/8.4.0...8.4.1) (2024-04-29)


### Bug Fixes

* Add observer as explicit dependency ([#272](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/272)) ([f2226a6](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/commit/f2226a60295c06d0b154a8eaee6dd2fb42a5cd76)), closes [#271](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/271)

## [8.4.0](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/compare/8.3.1...8.4.0) (2024-04-05)

This release introduces a Hooks API. Hooks are collections of user-defined callbacks that are executed by the SDK at various points of interest. You can use them to augment the SDK with metrics or tracing.

### Features

* Remove invalid prereq `check_variation_range` check ([#261](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/261)) ([#263](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/263)) ([74ca206](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/commit/74ca2067fafead5325d824f8923ddb5ced83196d)), closes [#260](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/260)

## [8.3.0](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/compare/8.2.0...8.3.0) (2024-03-14)


### Features

* Inline contexts for all evaluation events ([#245](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/245)) ([bd30c3b](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/commit/bd30c3be7a832c14a9b9d2757b651169079a8c10))
* Redact anonymous attributes within feature events ([#246](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/246)) ([640ac39](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/commit/640ac393e6a9b7b0e9785b05917ec4301d4a3a90))

## [8.2.0](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/compare/8.1.0...8.2.0) (2024-02-20)


### Features

* Enable gzip compression on polling requests ([#249](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/249)) ([abffe47](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/commit/abffe476093a8203f262be337b0bc3a4ec6ba982))

## [8.1.0](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/compare/8.0.0...8.1.0) (2024-01-03)


### Features

* Add hash access and equality support to LDContext ([#241](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/241)) ([1ba6bde](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/commit/1ba6bde61fd8ed5a197fee74770a0aa5ab5222c8))
* Define equality methods for LDContext and Reference ([#232](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/232)) ([1b2ba7b](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/commit/1b2ba7bfd9ebfccfa7717cbd5c32665bc5f380db))


### Bug Fixes

* Calling stop in ldd mode no longer raises an exception ([#237](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/237)) ([8149da1](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/commit/8149da1897d6da6bc9325c977df02f355173b135))

## [7.3.2](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/compare/7.3.1...7.3.2) (2023-12-26)


### Bug Fixes

* Update missed version bump to LaunchDarkly::VERSION ([#239](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/239)) ([dc44559](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/commit/dc44559a993f8cf2320532ef456421c103f87154))

## [7.3.1](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/compare/7.3.0...7.3.1) (2023-12-26)


### Bug Fixes

* Calling stop in ldd mode no longer raises an exception ([#235](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/235)) ([eeb9906](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/commit/eeb9906768f0519ac8d39def50226ed6bc8cb9ba))

## [8.0.0] - 2023-10-17
The latest version of this SDK supports the ability to manage migrations or modernizations, using migration flags. You might use this functionality if you are optimizing queries, upgrading to new tech stacks, migrating from one database to another, or other similar technology changes. Migration flags are part of LaunchDarkly's Early Access Program. This feature is available to all LaunchDarkly customers but may undergo additional changes before it is finalized.

For detailed information about this version, refer to the list below. For information on how to upgrade from the previous version, read the [migration guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/server-side/ruby/migration-7-to-8).

### Added:
- A new `Migrator` type which provides an out-of-the-box configurable migration framework.
- For more advanced use cases, added new `migration_variation` and `track_migration_op` methods on `LDClient`.

### Removed:
- Ruby 2.7 support was removed.
- The legacy user format for contexts is no longer supported.  To learn more, read the [Contexts documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/guides/flags/intro-contexts).
- Previously deprecated config options `user_keys_capacity`, `user_keys_flush_interval`, `private_attribute_names`, `default_user_keys_capacity`, `user_cache_size`, `user_cache_time`, and `default_user_keys_flush_interval` have been removed.
- Previously deprecated test data flag builder methods `variation_for_all_users`, `value_for_all_users`, and `clear_user_targets` have been removed.

## [7.3.0] - 2023-10-16
### Fixed:
- The documentation for the `default_connect_timeout` setting stated it defaulted to 10 seconds when the code actually defaults to 2. (Thanks, [zmagg-figma](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/pull/223)!)

### Deprecated:
- Creating an `LDContext` using the legacy user format has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. To learn more, read the [Contexts documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/guides/flags/intro-contexts).

## [7.2.0] - 2023-05-04
### Added:
- You can monitor the status of the SDK's data source (which normally means the streaming connection to the LaunchDarkly service) with `LaunchDarkly::LDClient.data_source_status_provider`. This allows you to check the current connection status, and to be notified if this status changes.
- You can monitor the status of a data store with `LaunchDarkly::LDClient.data_store_status_provider`. This allows you to check whether updates are succeeding and to be notified if this status changes.
- You can tell the SDK to notify you whenever a feature flag's configuration has changed (either in general, or in terms of its result for a specific context), using `LaunchDarkly::LDClient.flag_tracker`.

## [7.1.0] - 2023-04-13
### Added:
- Support for Payload Filtering in streaming and polling modes. Payload Filtering is a beta feature that allows SDKs to download a subset of environment data, rather than full environments.

## [7.0.4] - 2023-04-03
### Added:
- Added flag key to log message to ease debugging. (Thanks, [matt-dutchie](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/pull/214)!)

## [7.0.3] - 2023-03-17
### Changed:
- Updated underlying event source library to address issue with `Content-Type` header detection in some customer environments.

## [7.0.2] - 2023-01-27
### Fixed:
- Fixed JSON serialization error on internal models.

## [7.0.1] - 2023-01-19
### Changed:
- Improved logging of feature flag data validation errors so that they are logged once at the time the SDK receives the data, rather than during each evaluation of the flag.

### Fixed:
- Removed a misleading error message about a missing attribute that was being logged when a flag rule used the "is in segment" operator.

## [7.0.0] - 2022-12-30
The latest version of this SDK supports LaunchDarkly's new custom contexts feature. Contexts are an evolution of a previously-existing concept, "users." Contexts let you create targeting rules for feature flags based on a variety of different information, including attributes pertaining to users, organizations, devices, and more. You can even combine contexts to create "multi-contexts."

For detailed information about this version, please refer to the list below. For information on how to upgrade from the previous version, please read the [migration guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/server-side/ruby/migration-6-to-7).

### Added:
- The type `LaunchDarkly::LDContext` defines the new context model.
- All SDK methods that took a hash representing the user now also accept an `LDContext`.

### Changed _(breaking changes from 6.x)_:
- The `secondary` attribute which existed in the user hash is no longer a supported feature. If you set an attribute with that name in `LDContext`, it will simply be a custom attribute like any other.
- Analytics event data now uses a new JSON schema due to differences between the context model and the old user model.

### Changed (requirements/dependencies/build):
- The minimum language version is now Ruby 2.7, or jRuby 9.4.

### Changed (behavioral changes):
- Several optimizations within the flag evaluation logic have improved the performance of evaluations. For instance, target lists are now stored internally as sets for faster matching.

### Removed:
- Removed support for the `secondary` meta-attribute in the user hash.
- The `alias` method no longer exists because alias events are not needed in the new context model.
- The `inline_users_in_events` option no longer exists because it is not relevant in the new context model.
- Removed all types and options that were deprecated as of the most recent 6.x release.

### Deprecated:
- Config options `user_keys_capacity` and `user_keys_flush_interval` are being replaced with `context_keys_capacity` and `context_keys_flush_interval`.
- Config constants `default_user_keys_capacity` and `default_user_keys_flush_interval` are being replaced with `default_context_keys_capacity` and `default_context_keys_flush_interval`.

## [6.4.0] - 2022-09-07
### Added:
- New `Config` property `application_info`, for configuration of application metadata that may be used in LaunchDarkly analytics or other product features. This does not affect feature flag evaluations.

### Changed:
- The SDK now produces fewer short-lived objects as a side effect of flag evaluations, causing less work for the garbage collector in applications that evaluate flags very frequently. This change applies to all flag evaluations, regardless of whether analytics events are enabled.

## [6.3.4] - 2022-06-29
### Changed:
- Miscellaneous improvements to memory usage in analytics event processing: the SDK now allocates somewhat fewer short-lived objects when computing the analytics data for flag evaluations. This does not affect baseline memory usage by the SDK, but could somewhat reduce the need for garbage collection over an application's lifetime.
- The decrease in allocation of short-lived objects is much more significant if analytics events are completely disabled. Previously, the SDK created and then discarded event-related objects in this case even though they were not being used.

## [6.3.3] - 2022-06-15
### Fixed:
- Improved efficiency of SSE parsing to reduce transient memory/CPU usage spikes when receiving flag/segment data for a large LaunchDarkly environment. (Thanks, [sq-square](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-eventsource/pull/32)!)

## [6.3.2] - 2022-03-18
### Added:
- Add `initial_reconnect_delay` option to config which controls the initial delay for reconnecting the streaming connection.
- CI builds now include a cross-platform test suite implemented in https://github.com/launchdarkly/sdk-test-harness. This covers many test cases that are also implemented in unit tests, but may be extended in the future to ensure consistent behavior across SDKs in other areas.

### Fixed:
- The `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables are now correctly applied for all requests to LaunchDarkly. Previously, this setting worked for streaming flag requests, but did not work for analytics event delivery (or flag polling), causing the latter to be attempted without using the proxy.
- Rules targeting `secondary` attribute on user will now reference the correct value.
- `all_flags_state` will return invalid flag state if the store hasn't initialized properly.
- When using `all_flags_state` to produce bootstrap data for the JavaScript SDK, the Ruby SDK was not returning the correct metadata for evaluations that involved an experiment. As a result, the analytics events produced by the JavaScript SDK did not correctly reflect experimentation results.
- The info level message logged when using DynamoDB now correctly identifies the feature store description. ([#195](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/195))

### Changed:
- Providing a configuration hash when instantiating a persistent store is now optional.

## [6.3.1] - 2021-12-31
### Fixed:
- Fixed a bug that could cause a streaming connection to fail intermittently if the feature flag data contained UTF-8 characters outside of the ASCII character set. This would happen if a multi-byte character happened to be split across two successive reads from the stream, so the chances of it happening varied according to how often international characters appeared in the data and how much buffering of reads was done by the OS.
- In JRuby only, stream reconnections would fail if the application explicitly set the initial reconnect delay to zero.

## [6.3.0] - 2021-12-09
### Added:
- The SDK now supports evaluation of Big Segments. See: https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/users/big-segments
- `LaunchDarkly::Integrations::TestData` is a new way to inject feature flag data programmatically into the SDK for testing—either with fixed values for each flag, or with targets and/or rules that can return different values for different users. Unlike `FileData`, this mechanism does not use any external resources, only the data that your test code has provided.

### Changed:
- To use the file data source feature, the preferred entry point is now `LaunchDarkly::Integrations::FileData.data_source` rather than `LaunchDarkly::FileDataSource.factory`. This makes the Ruby SDK more consistent with other SDKs, grouping together all of the optional "connecting the SDK to something else" features under `Integrations`, and using the method name `data_source` for consistency with the `Config` property that will receive the object.

### Deprecated:
- `LaunchDarkly::FileDataSource` (see above).

## [6.2.5] - 2021-10-12
### Fixed:
- Fixed a bug that caused unnecessarily heavy CPU usage when receiving very large sets of flag data from LaunchDarkly.
- Improved the speed of making the initial streaming connection to LaunchDarkly. The delay that happens before reconnecting after a connection failure was mistakenly being applied before the first connection.

## [6.2.4] - 2021-08-11
### Changed:
- The dependency version constraint for the `http` gem is now looser: it allows 5.x versions as well as 4.x. The breaking changes in `http` v5.0.0 do not affect the SDK. ([#184](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/184))
- The dependency version constraint for the `json` gem is also looser: it allows any 2.x version that is higher than the SDK&#39;s minimum dependency version, not just 2.3. ([#184](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/184))
- The project&#39;s build now uses v2.2.10 of `bundler` due to known vulnerabilities in other versions.

## [6.2.3] - 2021-08-06
### Fixed:
- Diagnostic events did not properly set the `usingProxy` attribute when a proxy was configured with the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable. ([#182](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/182))

## [6.2.2] - 2021-07-23
### Fixed:
- Enabling debug logging in polling mode could cause polling to fail with a `NameError`. (Thanks, [mmurphy-notarize](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/pull/180)!)

## [6.2.1] - 2021-07-15
### Changed:
- If `variation` or `variation_detail` is called with a user object that has no `key` (an invalid condition that will always result in the default value being returned), the SDK now logs a `warn`-level message to alert you to this incorrect usage. This makes the Ruby SDK&#39;s logging behavior consistent with the other server-side LaunchDarkly SDKs. ([#177](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/177))

## [6.2.0] - 2021-06-17
### Added:
- The SDK now supports the ability to control the proportion of traffic allocation to an experiment. This works in conjunction with a new platform feature now available to early access customers.

## [6.1.1] - 2021-05-27
### Fixed:
- Calling `variation` with a nil user parameter is invalid, causing the SDK to log an error and return a fallback value, but the SDK was still sending an analytics event for this. An event without a user is meaningless and can&#39;t be processed by LaunchDarkly. This is now fixed so the SDK will not send one.

## [6.1.0] - 2021-02-04
### Added:
- Added the `alias` method. This can be used to associate two user objects for analytics purposes by generating an alias event.


## [6.0.0] - 2021-01-26
### Added:
- Added a `socket_factory` configuration option which can be used for socket creation by the HTTP client if provided. The value of `socket_factory` must be an object providing an `open(uri, timeout)` method and returning a connected socket.

### Changed:
- Switched to the `http` gem instead of `socketry` (with a custom http client) for streaming, and instead of `Net::HTTP` for polling / events.
- User keys are required to be a string type. The SDK will no longer automatically perform this conversion.
- Dropped support for Ruby &lt; version 2.5
- Dropped support for JRuby &lt; version 9.2
- Switched the default polling domain from `app.launchdarkly.com` to `sdk.launchdarkly.com`.

## [5.8.2] - 2021-01-19
### Fixed:
- Fixed a warning within the Redis integration when run with version 4.3 or later of the `redis` gem. (Thanks, [emancu](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/pull/167)!)


## [5.8.1] - 2020-11-09
### Fixed:
- Updated `json` gem to patch [CVE-2020-10663](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10663).


## [5.8.0] - 2020-05-27
### Added:
- In `LaunchDarkly::Integrations::Redis::new_feature_store`, if you pass in an externally created `pool`, you can now set the new option `pool_shutdown_on_close` to `false` to indicate that the SDK should _not_ shut down this pool if the SDK is shut down. The default behavior, as before, is that it will be shut down. (Thanks, [jacobthemyth](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/pull/158)!)

## [5.7.4] - 2020-05-04
### Fixed:
- Setting a user&#39;s `custom` property explicitly to `nil`, rather than omitting it entirely or setting it to an empty hash, would cause the SDK to log an error and drop the current batch of analytics events. Now, it will be treated the same as an empty hash. ([#147](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/147))

## [5.7.3] - 2020-04-27
### Changed:
- Previously, installing the SDK in an environment that did not have `openssl` would cause a failure at build time. The SDK still requires `openssl` at runtime, but this check has been removed because it caused the `rake` problem mentioned below, and because `openssl` is normally bundled in modern Ruby versions.

### Fixed:
- The `LDClient` constructor will fail immediately with a descriptive `ArgumentError` if you provide a `nil` SDK key in a configuration that requires an SDK key (that is, a configuration that _will_ require communicating with LaunchDarkly services). Previously, it would still fail, but without a clear error message. You are still allowed to omit the SDK key in an offline configuration. ([#154](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/154))
- Removed a hidden dependency on `rake` which could cause your build to fail if you had a dependency on this SDK and you did not have `rake` installed. ([#155](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/155))
- Previously a clause in a feature flag rule that used a string operator (such as &#34;starts with&#34;) or a numeric operator (such as &#34;greater than&#34;) could cause evaluation of the flag to completely fail and return a default value if the value on the right-hand side of the expression did not have the right data type-- for instance, &#34;greater than&#34; with a string value. The LaunchDarkly dashboard does not allow creation of such a rule, but it might be possible to do so via the REST API; the correct behavior of the SDK is to simply treat the expression as a non-match.

## [5.7.2] - 2020-03-27
### Fixed:
- Fixed a bug in the 5.7.0 and 5.7.1 releases that caused analytics events not to be sent unless diagnostic events were explicitly disabled. This also caused an error to be logged: `undefined method started?`.

## [5.7.1] - 2020-03-18
### Fixed:
- The backoff delay logic for reconnecting after a stream failure was broken so that if a failure occurred after a stream had been active for at least 60 seconds, retries would use _no_ delay, potentially causing a flood of requests and a spike in CPU usage. This bug was introduced in version 5.5.0 of the SDK.

## [5.7.0] - 2020-03-10
### Added:
- The SDK now periodically sends diagnostic data to LaunchDarkly, describing the version and configuration of the SDK, the architecture and version of the runtime platform, and performance statistics. No credentials, hostnames, or other identifiable values are included. This behavior can be disabled with `Config.diagnostic_opt_out` or configured with `Config.diagnostic_recording_interval`.
- New `Config` properties `wrapper_name` and `wrapper_version` allow a library that uses the Ruby SDK to identify itself for usage data if desired.

### Removed:
- Removed an unused dependency on `rake`.

## [5.6.2] - 2020-01-15
### Fixed:
- The SDK now specifies a uniquely identifiable request header when sending events to LaunchDarkly to ensure that events are only processed once, even if the SDK sends them two times due to a failed initial attempt.

## [5.6.1] - 2020-01-06
### Fixed:
- In rare circumstances (depending on the exact data in the flag configuration, the flag's salt value, and the user properties), a percentage rollout could fail and return a default value, logging the error "Data inconsistency in feature flag ... variation/rollout object with no variation or rollout". This would happen if the user's hashed value fell exactly at the end of the last "bucket" (the last variation defined in the rollout). This has been fixed so that the user will get the last variation.

## [5.6.0] - 2019-08-28
### Added:
- Added support for upcoming LaunchDarkly experimentation features. See `LDClient.track()`.

## [5.5.12] - 2019-08-05
### Fixed:
- Under conditions where analytics events are being generated at an extremely high rate (for instance, if an application is evaluating a flag repeatedly in a tight loop on many threads), it was possible for the internal event processing logic to fall behind on processing the events, causing them to use more and more memory. The logic has been changed to drop events if necessary so that besides the existing limit on the number of events waiting to be sent to LaunchDarkly (`config.capacity`), the same limit also applies on the number of events that are waiting to be processed by the worker thread that decides whether or not to send them to LaunchDarkly. If that limit is exceeded, this warning message will be logged once: "Events are being produced faster than they can be processed; some events will be dropped". Under normal conditions this should never happen; this change is meant to avoid a concurrency bottleneck in applications that are already so busy that thread starvation is likely.

## [5.5.11] - 2019-07-24
### Fixed:
- `FileDataSource` was using `YAML.load`, which has a known [security vulnerability](https://trailofbits.github.io/rubysec/yaml/index.html). This has been changed to use `YAML.safe_load`, which will refuse to parse any files that contain the `!` directives used in this type of attack. This issue does not affect any applications that do not use `FileDataSource` (which is meant for testing purposes, not production use). ([#139](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/139))


## [5.5.10] - 2019-07-24
This release was an error; it is identical to 5.5.9.

## [5.5.9] - 2019-07-23
### Fixed:
- Due to the gem name no longer being the same as the `require` name, Bundler autoloading was no longer working in versions 5.5.7 and 5.5.8 of the SDK. This has been fixed. (Thanks, [tonyta](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/pull/137)!)

## [5.5.8] - 2019-07-11
### Fixed:
- In streaming mode, depending on the Ruby version, calling `close` on the client could cause a misleading warning message in the log, such as `Unexpected error from event source: #<IOError: stream closed in another thread>`. ([#135](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/135))

## [5.5.7] - 2019-05-13
### Changed:
- Changed the gem name from `ldclient-rb` to `launchdarkly-server-sdk`.

There are no other changes in this release. Substituting `ldclient-rb` version 5.5.6 with `launchdarkly-server-sdk` version 5.5.7 will not affect functionality.

## [5.5.6] - 2019-05-08
### Fixed:
- CI tests now include Ruby 2.6.x.
- Running the SDK unit tests is now simpler, as the database integrations can be skipped. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

# Note on future releases

The LaunchDarkly SDK repositories are being renamed for consistency. This repository is now `ruby-server-sdk` rather than `ruby-client`.

The gem name will also change. In the 5.5.6 release, it is still `ldclient-rb`; in all future releases, it will be `launchdarkly-server-sdk`. No further updates to the `ldclient-rb` gem will be published after this release.


## [5.5.5] - 2019-03-28
### Fixed:
- Setting user attributes to non-string values when a string was expected would cause analytics events not to be processed. Also, in the case of the `secondary` attribute, this could cause evaluations to fail for a flag with a percentage rollout. The SDK will now convert attribute values to strings as needed. ([#131](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/131))

## [5.5.4] - 2019-03-29
### Fixed:
- Fixed a missing `require` that could sometimes cause a `NameError` to be thrown when starting the client, depending on what other gems were installed. This bug was introduced in version 5.5.3. ([#129](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/129))
- When an analytics event was generated for a feature flag because it is a prerequisite for another flag that was evaluated, the user data was being omitted from the event. ([#128](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/128))
- If `track` or `identify` is called without a user, the SDK now logs a warning, and does not send an analytics event to LaunchDarkly (since it would not be processed without a user).
- Added a link from the SDK readme to the guide regarding the client initialization.

## [5.5.3] - 2019-02-13
### Changed:
- The SDK previously used the `faraday` and `net-http-persistent` gems for all HTTP requests other than streaming connections. Since `faraday` lacks a stable version and has a known issue with character encoding, and `net-http-persistent` is no longer maintained, these have both been removed. This should not affect any SDK functionality.

### Fixed:
- The SDK was not usable in Windows because of `net-http-persistent`. That gem has been removed.
- When running in Windows, the event-processing thread threw a `RangeError` due to a difference in the Windows implementation of `concurrent-ruby`. This has been fixed.
- Windows incompatibilities were undetected before because we were not running a Windows CI job. We are now testing on Windows with Ruby 2.5.

## [5.5.2] - 2019-01-18
### Fixed:
- Like 5.5.1, this release contains only documentation fixes. Implementation classes that are not part of the supported API are now hidden from the [generated documentation](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ldclient-rb).


## [5.5.1] - 2019-01-17
### Fixed:
- Fixed several documentation comments that had the wrong parameter names. There are no other changes in this release; it's only to correct the documentation.

## [5.5.0] - 2019-01-17
### Added:
- It is now possible to use Consul or DynamoDB as a persistent feature store, similar to the existing Redis integration. See the `LaunchDarkly::Integrations::Consul` and `LaunchDarkly::Integrations::DynamoDB` modules, and the reference guide [Persistent data stores](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/concepts/data-stores).
- There is now a `LaunchDarkly::Integrations::Redis` module, which is the preferred method for creating a Redis feature store.
- All of the database feature stores now support local caching not only for individual feature flag queries, but also for `all_flags_state`.
- The `Config` property `data_source` is the new name for `update_processor` and `update_processor_factory`.

### Changed:
- The implementation of the SSE protocol for streaming has been moved into a separate gem, [`ld-eventsource`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-eventsource). This has no effect on streaming functionality.

### Fixed:
- Added or corrected a large number of documentation comments. All API classes and methods are now documented, and internal implementation details have been hidden from the documentation. You can view the latest documentation on [RubyDoc](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ldclient-rb).
- Fixed a problem in the Redis feature store that would only happen under unlikely circumstances: trying to evaluate a flag when the LaunchDarkly client had not yet been fully initialized and the store did not yet have data in it, and then trying again when the client was still not ready but the store _did_ have data (presumably put there by another process). Previously, the second attempt would fail.
- In polling mode, the SDK did not correctly handle non-ASCII Unicode characters in feature flag data. ([#90](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/90))

### Deprecated:
- `RedisFeatureStore.new`. This implementation class may be changed or moved in the future; use `LaunchDarkly::Integrations::Redis::new_feature_store`.
- `Config.update_processor` and `Config.update_processor_factory`; use `Config.data_source`.

## [5.4.3] - 2019-01-11
### Changed:
- The SDK is now compatible with `net-http-persistent` 3.x. (Thanks, [CodingAnarchy](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/pull/113)!)

## [5.4.2] - 2019-01-04
### Fixed:
- Fixed overly specific dependency versions of `concurrent-ruby` and `semantic`. ([#115](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/issues/115))
- Removed obsolete dependencies on `hashdiff` and `thread_safe`.

## [5.4.1] - 2018-11-05
### Fixed:
- Fixed a `LoadError` in `file_data_source.rb`, which was added in 5.4.0. (Thanks, [kbarrette](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/pull/110)!)


## [5.4.0] - 2018-11-02
### Added:
- It is now possible to inject feature flags into the client from local JSON or YAML files, replacing the normal LaunchDarkly connection. This would typically be for testing purposes. See `file_data_source.rb`.

### Fixed:
- When shutting down an `LDClient`, if in polling mode, the client was using `Thread.raise` to make the polling thread stop sleeping. `Thread.raise` can cause unpredictable behavior in a worker thread, so it is no longer used.

## [5.3.0] - 2018-10-24
### Added:
- The `all_flags_state` method now accepts a new option, `details_only_for_tracked_flags`, which reduces the size of the JSON representation of the flag state by omitting some metadata. Specifically, it omits any data that is normally used for generating detailed evaluation events if a flag does not have event tracking or debugging turned on.

### Fixed:
- JSON data from `all_flags_state` is now slightly smaller even if you do not use the new option described above, because it omits the flag property for event tracking unless that property is true.

## [5.2.0] - 2018-08-29
### Added:
- The new `LDClient` method `variation_detail` allows you to evaluate a feature flag (using the same parameters as you would for `variation`) and receive more information about how the value was calculated. This information is returned in an `EvaluationDetail` object, which contains both the result value and a "reason" object which will tell you, for instance, if the user was individually targeted for the flag or was matched by one of the flag's rules, or if the flag returned the default value due to an error.

### Fixed:
- Evaluating a prerequisite feature flag did not produce an analytics event if the prerequisite flag was off.

 
## [5.1.0] - 2018-08-27
### Added:
- The new `LDClient` method `all_flags_state()` should be used instead of `all_flags()` if you are passing flag data to the front end for use with the JavaScript SDK. It preserves some flag metadata that the front end requires in order to send analytics events correctly. Versions 2.5.0 and above of the JavaScript SDK are able to use this metadata, but the output of `all_flags_state()` will still work with older versions.
- The `all_flags_state()` method also allows you to select only client-side-enabled flags to pass to the front end, by using the option `client_side_only: true`.

### Changed:
- Unexpected exceptions are now logged at `ERROR` level, and exception stacktraces at `DEBUG` level. Previously, both were being logged at `WARN` level.

### Deprecated:
- `LDClient.all_flags()`


## [5.0.1] - 2018-07-02
### Fixed:
Fixed a regression in version 5.0.0 that could prevent the client from reconnecting if the stream connection was dropped by the server.


## [5.0.0] - 2018-06-26
### Changed:
- The client no longer uses Celluloid for streaming I/O. Instead, it uses [socketry](https://github.com/socketry/socketry).
- The client now treats most HTTP 4xx errors as unrecoverable: that is, after receiving such an error, it will not make any more HTTP requests for the lifetime of the client instance, in effect taking the client offline. This is because such errors indicate either a configuration problem (invalid SDK key) or a bug, which is not likely to resolve without a restart or an upgrade. This does not apply if the error is 400, 408, 429, or any 5xx error.
- During initialization, if the client receives any of the unrecoverable errors described above, the client constructor will return immediately; previously it would continue waiting until a timeout. The `initialized?` method will return false in this case.

### Removed:
- The SDK no longer supports Ruby versions below 2.2.6, or JRuby below 9.1.16.

## [4.0.0] - 2018-05-10

### Changed:
- To reduce the network bandwidth used for analytics events, feature request events are now sent as counters rather than individual events, and user details are now sent only at intervals rather than in each event. These behaviors can be modified through the LaunchDarkly UI and with the new configuration option `inline_users_in_events`.

### Removed:
- JRuby 1.7 is no longer supported.
- Greatly reduced the number of indirect gem dependencies by removing `moneta`, which was previously a requirement for the Redis feature store.


## [3.0.3] - 2018-03-23
## Fixed
- In the Redis feature store, fixed a synchronization problem that could cause a feature flag update to be missed if several of them happened in rapid succession.

## [3.0.2] - 2018-03-06
## Fixed
- Improved efficiency of logging by not constructing messages that won't be visible at the current log level. (Thanks, [julik](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/pull/98)!)


## [3.0.1] - 2018-02-26
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that could prevent very large feature flags from being updated in streaming mode.


## [3.0.0] - 2018-02-22
### Added
- Support for a new LaunchDarkly feature: reusable user segments.

### Changed
- The feature store interface has been changed to support user segment data as well as feature flags. Existing code that uses `InMemoryFeatureStore` or `RedisFeatureStore` should work as before, but custom feature store implementations will need to be updated.


## [2.5.0] - 2018-02-12

## Added
- Adds support for a future LaunchDarkly feature, coming soon: semantic version user attributes.

## Changed
- It is now possible to compute rollouts based on an integer attribute of a user, not just a string attribute.

## [2.4.1] - 2018-01-23
## Changed
- Reduce logging level for missing flags
- Relax json and faraday dependencies
## Fixed
- Wrap redis bulk updates in a transaction
- Fixed documentation links

## [2.4.0] - 2018-01-12
## Changed
- Will use feature store if already initialized even if connection to service could not be established.  This is useful when flags have been initialized in redis.
- Increase default and  minimum polling interval to 30s
- Strip out unknown top-level attributes

## [2.3.2] - 2017-12-02

### Fixed
- Make sure redis store initializations are atomic


## [2.3.1] - 2017-11-16

### Changed
- Include source code for changes described in 2.3.0


## [2.3.0] - 2017-11-16
## Added
- Add `close` method to Ruby client to stop processing events
- Add support for Redis feature store
- Add support for LDD mode
- Allow user to disable outgoing event stream.

## Changed
- Stop retrying on 401 responses (due to bad sdk keys)

## [2.2.7] - 2017-07-26
## Changed
- Update Readme to fix instructions on installing gem using command line
- Cleaned up formatting on various files (Rubocop)
## [2.2.5] - 2017-05-08
## Changed
- Added proxy support to streaming and http connections. Respects `HTTP_PROXY` and `http_proxy` environment variables as well as the `:proxy => protocol://user:pass@host` configuration parameter.

## [2.1.5] - 2017-03-28
## Changed
- Updated changelog 

## [2.1.1] - 2017-03-28
## Changed
- Bumped nio4r to 2.0

## [2.0.6] - 2017-02-10
## Changed
- Improved handling of http status codes that may not be integers.

## [2.0.5] - 2017-01-31
## Changed
- Improved error handling when connected to flag update stream.

## [2.0.3] - 2016-10-21
## Fixed
- Indirect stream events are now correctly processed

## [2.0.2] - 2016-08-08
## Changed
- The default logger now logs at `info` level

## [2.0.0] - 2016-08-08
### Added
- Support for multivariate feature flags. In addition to booleans, feature flags can now return numbers, strings, dictionaries, or arrays via the `variation` method.
- New `all_flags` method returns all flag values for a specified user.
- If streaming is disabled, the client polls for feature flag changes. If streaming is disabled, the client will default to polling LaunchDarkly every second for updates. The poll interval is configurable via `poll_interval`.
- New `secure_mode_hash` function computes a hash suitable for the new LaunchDarkly JavaScript client's secure mode feature.
- Support for extremely large feature flags. When a large feature flag changes, the stream will include a directive to fetch the updated flag.

### Changed
- You can now initialize the LaunchDarkly client with an optional timeout (specified in seconds). This will block initialization until the client has finished bootstrapping and is able to serve feature flags.
- The streaming implementation (`StreamProcessor`) uses [Celluloid](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid) under the hood instead of [EventMachine](https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine). The dependency on EventMachine has been removed.
- The `store` option has been renamed to `cache_store`.
- Offline mode can no longer be set dynamically. Instead, at configuration time, the `offline` parameter can be set to put the client in offline mode. It is no longer possible to dynamically change whether the client is online and offline (via `set_online` and `set_offline`). Call `offline?` to determine whether or not the client is offline.
- The `debug_stream` configuration option has been removed.
- The `log_timings` configuration option has been removed.

### Deprecated
- The `toggle` call has been deprecated in favor of `variation`.

### Removed
- `update_user_flag_setting` has been removed. To change user settings, use the LaunchDarkly REST API.
