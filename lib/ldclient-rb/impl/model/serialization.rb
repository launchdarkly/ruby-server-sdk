# General implementation notes about the data model classes in LaunchDarkly::Impl::Model--
#
# As soon as we receive flag/segment JSON data from LaunchDarkly (or, read it from a database), we
# transform it into the model classes FeatureFlag, Segment, etc. The constructor of each of these
# classes takes a hash (the parsed JSON), and transforms it into an internal representation that
# is more efficient for evaluations.
#
# Validation works as follows:
# - A property value that is of the correct type, but is invalid for other reasons (for example,
# if a flag rule refers to variation index 5, but there are only 2 variations in the flag), does
# not prevent the flag from being parsed and stored. It does cause a warning to be logged, if a
# logger was passed to the constructor.
# - If a value is completely invalid for the schema, the constructor may throw an
# exception, causing the whole data set to be rejected. This is consistent with the behavior of
# the strongly-typed SDKs.
#
# Currently, the model classes also retain the original hash of the parsed JSON. This is because
# we may need to re-serialize them to JSON, and building the JSON on the fly would be very
# inefficient, so each model class has a to_json method that just returns the same Hash. If we
# are able in the future to either use a custom streaming serializer, or pass the JSON data
# straight through from LaunchDarkly to a database instead of re-serializing, we could stop
# retaining this data.
