    #
    # Mixin that defines the required methods of a feature store implementation. The LaunchDarkly
    # client uses the feature store to persist feature flags and related objects received from
    # the LaunchDarkly service. Implementations must support concurrent access and updates.
    # For more about how feature stores can be used, see:
    # [Using a persistent feature store](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/storing-data#ruby).
    #
    # An entity that can be stored in a feature store is a hash that can be converted to and from
    # JSON, and that has at a minimum the following properties: `:key`, a string that is unique
    # among entities of the same kind; `:version`, an integer that is higher for newer data;
    # `:deleted`, a boolean (optional, defaults to false) that if true means this is a
    # placeholder for a deleted entity.
    #
    # To represent the different kinds of objects that can be stored, such as feature flags and
    # segments, the SDK will provide a "kind" object; this is a hash with a single property,
    # `:namespace`, which is a short string unique to that kind. This string can be used as a
    # collection name or a key prefix.
    #
    # The default implementation is {LaunchDarkly::InMemoryFeatureStore}. Several implementations
    # that use databases can be found in {LaunchDarkly::Integrations}. If you want to write a new
    # implementation, see {LaunchDarkly::Integrations::Util} for tools that can make this task
    # simpler.
    #
    module FeatureStore
      #
      # Initializes (or re-initializes) the store with the specified set of entities. Any
      # existing entries will be removed. Implementations can assume that this data set is up to
      # date-- there is no need to perform individual version comparisons between the existing
      # objects and the supplied features.
      #
      # If possible, the store should update the entire data set atomically. If that is not possible,
      # it should iterate through the outer hash and then the inner hash using the existing iteration
      # order of those hashes (the SDK will ensure that the items were inserted into the hashes in
      # the correct order), storing each item, and then delete any leftover items at the very end.
      #
      # @param all_data [Hash]  a hash where each key is one of the data kind objects, and each
      #   value is in turn a hash of string keys to entities

      # @return [Hash]  the entity; nil if the key was not found, or if the stored entity's
      #   `:deleted` property was true

      # @param kind [Object]  the kind of entity to delete

      # This is normally only true for persistent data stores but it could also

      #
      # Returning true means that the store guarantees that if it ever enters
      # an invalid state (that is, an operation has failed or it knows that
      # operations cannot succeed at the moment), it will publish a status
      # update, and will then publish another status update once it has
      # returned to a valid state.
      #
      # Custom implementations must implement `def available?` which
      # synchronously checks if the store is available. Without this method,
      # the SDK cannot ensure status updates will occur once the store has gone
      # offline.
