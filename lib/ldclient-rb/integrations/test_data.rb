    #
    # A mechanism for providing dynamically updatable feature flag state in a simplified form to an SDK
    # client in test scenarios.
    #
    # Unlike {LaunchDarkly::Integrations::FileData}, this mechanism does not use any external resources. It
    # provides only the data that the application has put into it using the {#update} method.
    #
    # @example
    #     td = LaunchDarkly::Integrations::TestData.data_source
    #     td.update(td.flag("flag-key-1").variation_for_all_users(true))
    #     config = LaunchDarkly::Config.new(data_source: td)
    #     client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new('sdkKey', config)
    #     # flags can be updated at any time:
    #     td.update(td.flag("flag-key-2")
    #                 .variation_for_user("some-user-key", true)
    #                 .fallthrough_variation(false))
    #
    # The above example uses a simple boolean flag, but more complex configurations are possible using
    # the methods of the {FlagBuilder} that is returned by {#flag}. {FlagBuilder}
    # supports many of the ways a flag can be configured on the LaunchDarkly dashboard, but does not
    # currently support 1. rule operators other than "in" and "not in", or 2. percentage rollouts.
    #
    # If the same `TestData` instance is used to configure multiple `LDClient` instances,
    # any changes made to the data will propagate to all of the `LDClient`s.
    #
    # @since 6.3.0

      # If this flag key has already been defined in this `TestData` instance, then the builder

      # `false` variations, is `true` for all users when targeting is turned on and
      # `false` otherwise, and currently has targeting turned on. You can change any of those
      # properties, and provide more complex behavior, using the {FlagBuilder} methods.
